The Faroese people are believed to have been the ones who created the calanish stones, as they were living there around that time. They didn't just use them for sacrifices, though - some were also used in funerary rituals and for other ceremonial purposes. It's fascinating to think about how these ancient structures relate to our modern understanding of history and heritage.
